Now let's learn some essential string and array methods like the `find()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, and `join()`.
These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities.
You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

You'll learn about the Web Audio API and how to use it to play songs.
All modern browsers support the Web Audio API, which lets you generate and process audio in web applications.

### An arrow function is a shorter and more concise way to write functions in JavaScript.

It's a function expression, which is a function that's assigned to a variable.
To write an arrow function, you can use the following syntax:

`// Traditional function`
`function add(a, b) {`
`return a + b;`
`}`
`console.log(add(3, 5)); // Output: 8`

// Arrow function
const addArrow = (a, b) => {
return a + b;
};
console.log(addArrow(3, 5)); // Output: 8

If the function body consists of a single expression, you don't need the curly braces and the return keyword. This is called an implicit return:

const addArrow = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(addArrow(3, 5)); // Output: 8
